# The Mini-Internet Wiki

You can use the sidebar on the right to access the documentation.

Note that all the source code and configuration files used to run the mini-Internet are in the `platform` directory.
In this documentation, we thus assume that you are in the `platform` directory.

Aside from this documentation, we also make the assignments available which we use in our lectures every year.
You can find them in the [communication_networks_course](https://github.com/nsg-ethz/mini_internet_project/tree/master/communication_networks_course) or in the [advanced_networks_course](https://github.com/nsg-ethz/mini_internet_project/tree/master/advanced_networks_course) directory.

For further information about how we use the mini-Internet at ETH ZÃ¼rich and how we implemented it,
please have a look at our [technical report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.02031.pdf).
