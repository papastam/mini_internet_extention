# Mini-internet extension

This github repository contains my batchelor thesis project at CSD, UOC.

The [mini-internet](mini-inter.net) platform is a teaching platform (made at ETHZ) that virtualizes a network of ASes assigned to teams of 2-3 students and provides them with a set of routers and switches to configure and connect to each other. The goal is to learn about the basics of networking and routing protocols. 

This platform is used for years now in the HY335B course at CSD and for my thesis I extended it with a couple of new features that can be seen below
