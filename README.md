# Mini-internet extension

This github repository contains my batchelor thesis project at CSD, UOC.

The [mini-internet](mini-inter.net) platform is a teaching platform (made at ETHZ) that virtualizes a network of ASes assigned to teams of 2-3 students and provides them with a set of routers and switches to configure and connect to each other. The goal is to learn about the basics of networking and routing protocols. 

This platform is used for years now in the HY335B course at CSD and for my thesis I extended it with a couple of new features that can be seen below
# New features
 - Restore mechanism from configuration file for
 - Hosts
 - Switches 
 - Routers
 - Visualization tool for AS topology
 - Visualization tool for traffic (traceroute, ping)
 - Pingall implementation
 - Traceroute all implementation
 - Decentralized or Cluster-based architecture- Interconnection between clusters and performance analysis
 - Auto grading and auto debuging tools for TA use
